I want you to build the COMPLETE STOREFRONT + CUSTOMER ACCOUNT SYSTEM that integrates directly with the Node/Express Dashboard backend you helped me build earlier.
This must NOT break the existing dashboard flow, but extend it perfectly.)

1. BUILD A FULL STOREFRONT FRONTEND

Create a responsive storefront UI (mobile + desktop) using the SAME header/footer design as the dashboard.

Pages required:

Home Page → /
Hero, featured products, category links, CTA buttons.

Products Page → /products
Product grid (3–4 column desktop, list mobile), Add-to-Cart.

Cart Page → /cart
Edit quantities, remove items, show totals, proceed to checkout.

Checkout Page → /checkout
Show order summary.
If customer not logged in → redirect to Login.

Receipt Page → /receipt?id=ORDER_ID
Show order receipt + “Download Receipt”.

My Account Page → /user-account
Profile details, phone, email, last seen, order history, logout.
Auto-logout after 30 min inactivity.

Frontend Requirements

Fully responsive

Smooth UI transitions

Mobile-first layout

Replit-ready static frontend

All pages connected to backend API

2. BUILD CUSTOMER ACCOUNT SYSTEM

Customer account system must integrate with dashboard’s customer module.

Sign-Up (Email + Phone only)

Save email + phone

Generate verification_token

Send verification email

User verifies via /verify?token=XXX

After verification → customer automatically added to dashboard Customers

Phone-Based Login (OTP System)

Step 1:
User enters phone → “Generate OTP”
Backend:

create 7-digit OTP

expires in 10 mins

send via email

Step 2:
User enters OTP → validate:

correct

not expired

not used

If valid:

create login session

redirect to /user-account

Blocking System (Dashboard-Controlled)
If the dashboard blocks a customer:

disallow OTP requests

show message: “Your account is blocked.”

Auto-Logout

If no activity for 30 minutes → logout and redirect to login

Update last_seen in dashboard

3. ORDER + RECEIPT SYSTEM
Checkout endpoint

POST /api/orders/create

Input includes:

cart items

totals

customer ID from session

Backend must:

create order

generate unique receipt ID

save order

forward order into dashboard Orders database

return receipt URL → /receipt?id=ORDER_ID

Receipt Page

Display:

customer info

order items

subtotal + total

date

receipt ID

Download receipt option

Dashboard Sync

Every order updates dashboard:

total orders

total spent

last seen

order row inserted

4. BACKEND FILE STRUCTURE

Create full Node/Express backend:

/storefront-backend
   /routes
      customers.js
      auth.js
      otp.js
      orders.js
      receipts.js

      customersController.js
      authController.js

   /models
      Customer.js
      OTP.js
      Order.js
      Session.js
   /middlewares
      authMiddleware.js
      sessionActivityTracker.js
   /utils
      emailSender.js
      otpGenerator.js
      tokenGenerator.js
      receiptGenerator.js
   server.js
